# Traffic-Simulation-C-MFC-
A graphical simulation of traffic using Visual Studio MFC. 

The simulation consists of 5 seperate vehicle classes, a 4, 6, and 8-cylinder car, an 18-wheeler truck, and panel truck. Each vehicle class has its own seperate properties in regards to speed and rate of accelerration. The traffic simulation also consists of traffic lights that will change color based on a timer class.  

The simulation gets data on the initial coordinates of the roads, traffic lights and vechicles from an xml file within the program directory. The simulation can also be run based on certain certain speeds decided by the client.
